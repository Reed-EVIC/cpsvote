\description{
While the U.S. Census Bureau provides one weight with the CPS, a modified
weight is needed to properly calculate voter turnout. This data set provides
those calculations, according to Achen and Hur (2013). The comparison data
comes from Dr. Michael McDonald's estimates of voter turnout among the
voting-eligible population (VEP). It can be joined with CPS data to
calculate the new weights needed for analysis, using the function
\code{cps_reweight_turnout}.
